# Time Series Analysis of PM2.5 Levels

This repository analyzes PM2.5 air pollution data collected during the summer of 2020 from various monitoring stations along the U.S. West Coast. The analysis employs time series models, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Dynamic Linear Models (DLM), to capture temporal and spatial dependencies, generate real-time forecasts, and identify pollution patterns.
